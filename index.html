					"Porgs were a species of non-sentient birds. They were stocky in nature, with two short wings, flat, beak-less faces, and two webbed feet. Porgs were sexually dimorphic; males were slightly larger than females,and males also had orange plumage around the eyes. Porgs of both sexes were covered in dense feathers, with white coloration on the body and face, and gray to brown on the wings and back. The birds had stereoscopic vision, colored with brown irises and black pupils. A group of porgs is called, a 'murder'.

					<li> How could you hate something so innocent and adorable? They aren't hurting anyone!</li>

					<li> There are several other characters who are way worse in Star Wars. Characters who actually put others in danger due to their stupidity... </li>
